# Geothermal Systems Exercises
## Methods, concepts, and more  

This repository comprises different notebooks accompanying my exercise lecture in _Geothermal Energy Systems_.  
Content of these exercise lectures cover the whole span of physical basics, over measurement procedures and their analysis, to numerical modelling of geothermal reservoirs and borehole heat exchangers.  
Next to the exercises held in class, there are additional explanatory jupyter-notebooks for providing more detailed explanations of topics discussed in class.

### Installation / Usage 
The .ipynb files, which are the core of this repository, are interactive [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/). You can directly use a static, rendered version of the notebook by clicking on it. GitHub has an implemented notebook-viewer.  
Further you can inspect notebooks on [NBviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) by following the links above.  

However, for working interactively with the notebooks (recommended), you either have to install Python + Jupyter (e.g. by using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#linux)), clone the repository and start a server. Or start them in an online, interactive environment, such as [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) (see below).

### Notebooks using Microsoft Azure Notebooks
The most convenient way is to use...

### Notebooks in an interactive environment:
You can also work on notebooks interactively by using _binder_. Click on the binder badge to get to a remote notebook server:
